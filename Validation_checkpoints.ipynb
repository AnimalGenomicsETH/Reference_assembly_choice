    "# Validation and check points\n",
    "\n",
    "As summarised in the [\"Processing pipeline notebook\"](Processing_pipeline.ipynb), a series of steps are needed in order to align the raw data for the two assemblies. Given the multiplicity of steps, the number of potential errors also increase. We definitely need a system in place to check whether all the files are being properly generated. The strategy will be many-folded:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure that all pipeline steps have been completed\n",
    "* Check that all samples have been successfully processed\n",
    "* Find out what of the samples have already had applied a QC (by FASTP)\n",
    "* Confirm that the number of reads is kept from the raw data to the aligned and sorted BAM files\n",
    "* Reduce as much as possible the storage footprint\n",
    "* Alternative methods for validating the results\n",

    "#### Snakemake as tool for tracking and checking results\n",
    "\n",
    "Snakemake is a very complete workflow manager. It does not only concatenates the different steps, automatise great amount of input files and optimise the resources used for every step, but it also generates specific logs for each and every job. Therefore, providing that logs are duly generated, these are very helpful to track errors in concrete steps. The logs are generated in a specific folder (/cluster/work/pausch/temp_scratch/audald/best_assembly/log_folder), where each rule/step will have a separate folder and each job (one job per sample or on job per read-group, depending on the rule) will have a unique log.\n",
    "The name of the logs and the directories are set in advance at the [cluster config file](Snakemake/cluster.json).\n",
    "\n",
    "Snakemake is also very interesting as you can define whether intermediate files (e.g. QC'ed FASTQ files or unsorted BAM) should be deleted as soon as the following file (e.g. split read-group-specific FASTQ files or de-duplicated and sorted BAM file) is created. This is defined in the very [Snakefile](Snakemake/Snakefile.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Have all rules been successfully completed for all samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first question to answer when the workflow has been completed. Hopefully all the steps will be successfully finished. If this is not the case, no problem, we can run the following lines of code so we really know where the problems arise and what are the concrete errors:"
