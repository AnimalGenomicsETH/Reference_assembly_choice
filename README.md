# Investigating the impact of reference assembly choice on genomic analyses in a cattle breed

This repository contains the bioinformatics scripts and workflows generated for assessing the impact of bovine reference assembly choice on genomic analysis. The structure of this repository matches the structure of the *Results* section of the manuscript:

1. Alignment quality and depth of coverage

Snakemake workflows and custom scripts developed for aligning the raw data to the reference genome and calculating the coverage from the aligned files can be found in the [relevant folder](Alignment_Coverage)

2. Sequence variant genotyping and variant statistics

3. Functional annotation of polymorphic sites

4. Signatures of selection

5. Genome-wide association testing

Developed for analysis of bovine genomes, but should be applicable to the other species as well.
